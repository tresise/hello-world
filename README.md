Looking for
I am looking for either a contract or permanent role, as an Agile Project Manager, Scrum Master, Business Analyst or Change Manager. Many of the positions have combined these roles in different proportions, often in very challenging environments and failing projects. The main issues were often poor requirements, a breakdown in stakeholder confidence and not surprisingly a subsequently lack of progress.  

So, it is likely that the best roles for me will complex, require good negotiation skills, a diplomatic approach, excellent technical understanding and the ability to take a multifaceted and contradictory situation and deliver a workable solution. 

The key to success has been the ability to get to the root cause of the issues and reformat the requirements in to a more structured and robust format so they can be understood by the stakeholders and signed off.
